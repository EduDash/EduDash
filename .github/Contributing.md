## Contributing

This is an open source project, meaning anyone is free to contribute as much or as little as they want. If you're just starting our with GitHub, then we suggest you take a look at any open issues on the repository. These will vary based on complexity.

If you're comfortable contributing to projects please make sure you read our expectations for issue tracking, feature proposals and pull requirests.

## Testing Changes

When you make changes you should always test to make sure they work as intended, if you see a pull request open, it is recommended you test the features to check for errors.

## Issue Tracking

Please use GitHub issues to track new features or bugs.

When submitting an issue, there's a few guidelines we'd ask you to respect to make it easier to manage and for others to understand:

- **Search the issue tracker** before you submit your issue - it may already be present.
- When opening an issue, a template is provided for you. Please provide as much information as requested to ensure others are able to act upon the requests or bug report.
- Please ensure you add screenshots or documentation references for bugs/changes so we can quickly ascertain if the request is suitable.

**In order to be 'assigned' an issue**, please comment on the issue itself letting others know you are working on it.

## Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests with fixes and improvements to the project.

If you wish to add a new feature or you spot a bug that you wish to fix, **please open an issue for it first** on the [EduDash issue tracker](https://github.com/EduDash/EduDash/issues).

The work-flow for submitting a new pull request is designed to be simple, but also to ensure consistency from **all** contributors:

- Fork the project into your personal space on GitHub.com.
- Create a new branch (with a clear name of what is being changed).
- Add changes to CHANGELOG.md with credits to yourself.
- Commit your changes.
- When writing commit messages make sure they are clear about what has been changed.
- Push the commit(s) to your fork.
- Submit a pull request (PR) to the master branch.
- The PR title should describe the change that has been made.
- Follow the PR template and write as much detail as necessary for your changes and include documents/screenshots if needed.
- Be prepared to answer any questions about your PR when it is reviewed for acceptance.

**Please** keep your changes in a single PR as small as possible (relating to one issue) as this makes it easier to review and accept. Large PRs with a small error will prevent the entire PR from being accepted.

**Ensure** that you include a CHANGELOG with your PR.
